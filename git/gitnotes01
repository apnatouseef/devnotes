### ✅ What is **Git**?

**Git** is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** used to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 (the creator of Linux) and is now the **most widely used VCS in the world**.

---

### 🔹 Key Features of Git:

* ✅ **Distributed**: Every developer has a full copy of the project (repository).
* ✅ **Fast**: Most operations are performed locally.
* ✅ **Branching & Merging**: Easy to create, switch, and merge branches.
* ✅ **History Tracking**: Keeps a log of who changed what and when.
* ✅ **Secure**: Uses checksums (SHA-1) to ensure data integrity.
* ✅ **Collaboration-Friendly**: Multiple developers can work in parallel.

---

### 🧠 Example Use-Cases of Git:

* Managing versions of source code
* Experimenting with new features in **branches**
* Reverting to previous stable versions when needed
* Working offline and syncing later

### ✅ What is **GitHub**?

**GitHub** is a **cloud-based platform** that provides **hosting for Git repositories**, along with **collaboration, project management, and CI/CD features**.

> 📍 Think of **GitHub** as **Facebook for coders** – where Git is the engine, and GitHub is the social platform around it.

---

### 🔹 Features of GitHub:

* ✅ **Remote Repository Hosting** (public or private)
* ✅ **Pull Requests** – Propose, review, and merge changes
* ✅ **Issues & Discussions** – Bug tracking and team communication
* ✅ **Actions** – Built-in CI/CD for automation
* ✅ **Wiki & Documentation**
* ✅ **Access Control & Team Management**
* ✅ **Integration with tools like Jira, Slack, AWS, etc.**

### 🔁 Git vs GitHub – Key Differences

| Feature            | **Git**                          | **GitHub**                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type               | Version Control Tool             | Git Repository Hosting & Collaboration Platform |
| Installed On       | Developer’s machine (local)      | Cloud (web-based)                               |
| Purpose            | Track changes locally & remotely | Collaborate, manage, and host code              |
| Requires Internet? | ❌ No (works offline)             | ✅ Yes (for most features)                       |
| Example Command    | `git commit`, `git push`         | GitHub GUI or web interface                     |
| Developed By       | Linus Torvalds                   | Microsoft (acquired in 2018)                    |

### ✅ Simple Workflow Using Git & GitHub:

1. `git init` → Create a Git repository locally.
2. `git add .` → Stage files for commit.
3. `git commit -m "Message"` → Save changes locally.
4. `git remote add origin <repo_URL>` → Link to GitHub.
5. `git push -u origin main` → Upload code to GitHub.
