### ‚úÖ What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that **tracks and manages changes to files** over time. It allows multiple developers to **collaborate**, **revert to previous versions**, and **maintain a history** of changes, making it essential for software development, documentation, and configuration management.

### ‚úÖ Types of Version Control Systems

There are two main types:

1. **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**
2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

---

### ‚úÖ Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

* **Single central server** holds the main codebase.
* Developers **pull (checkout)** from and **commit changes** directly to this server.

#### üîπ Examples:

* **SVN (Apache Subversion)**
* **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)**
* **Perforce**

#### üî∏ Pros:

* Simple to understand and use.
* Easier to manage access and permissions centrally.

#### üî∏ Cons:

* If the central server goes down, **no one can collaborate**.
* More prone to data loss if the central server fails.

---

### ‚úÖ Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

* Each developer has a **full copy (clone)** of the entire repository.
* Changes can be committed locally and later **pushed** to the main repository.

#### üîπ Examples:

* **Git** (most popular)
* **Mercurial (hg)**
* **Bazaar**
* **Fossil**

#### üî∏ Pros:

* Faster operations (local commits).
* Work offline.
* Better redundancy (each user has a backup).
* Branching and merging are easier.

#### üî∏ Cons:

* Slightly more complex to learn for beginners.
* Managing multiple copies can be harder in very large teams.

### ‚úÖ Key Differences: Centralized vs Distributed VCS

| Feature             | Centralized VCS (CVCS)                    | Distributed VCS (DVCS)          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Repository Location | Single central server                     | Every developer has a full copy |
| Work Offline        | ‚ùå No                                      | ‚úÖ Yes                           |
| Speed               | Slower (network dependency)               | Faster (local operations)       |
| Fault Tolerance     | Low (server is a single point of failure) | High (multiple backups)         |
| Commit Location     | Directly to central repo                  | Local first, then push          |
| Examples            | SVN, CVS, Perforce                        | Git, Mercurial, Bazaar          |

### ‚úÖ Most Popular VCS in the Market (2025)

1. **Git** ‚Äì Industry standard, used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
2. **GitHub / GitLab** ‚Äì Cloud-based Git platforms with CI/CD, issue tracking, collaboration.
3. **SVN** ‚Äì Still used in enterprises with legacy systems.
4. **Perforce (Helix Core)** ‚Äì Popular in game development and enterprise environments.
